# Deck of Cards
This deck of cards allows a user to create individual cards or a complete deck. It also has the ability to shuffle a deck and draw a random card.

Unit tests were written for this program using the Ruby Spec Suite. All tests, including bonus ones, passed successfully!

A card class was built that only accepts values and suits found on a regular playing card.
